"Windows Screen-Sharing Spyware"
This is another project where I attempted to create a Windows screen-sharing spyware.
The spyware will share the screen of the target device, allowing it to be viewed from
any part of the world. It is surprisingly undetectable by Malwarebytes and Windows 
Security. Once installed, the user will not be able to detect it. The spyware runs 
24/7 in the background and will automatically restart itself even after a Windows
device reboot.
I have provided the code here. To proceed, create a Restream account and generate
an RTMP URL and stream key from Restream. Replace these values in the sender.py code.
Then, I will provide you with some commands. Run CMD as an administrator, use the
given commands to download prerequisites, and then run the sender.py on the target
Windows device. Once installed, you can view the live screen sharing of the target
device on the Restream website.
